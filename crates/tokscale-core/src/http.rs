//! Shared construction of the workspace's HTTP clients.
//!
//! Every client except Cursor's goes through here, and every client here is
//! pinned to rustls with an explicit `use_rustls_tls()` rather than relying on
//! reqwest's default backend.
//!
//! The explicitness is load-bearing, not decoration. reqwest's `native-tls`
//! feature implies `default-tls`, and `impl Default for TlsBackend`
//! (reqwest `src/tls.rs`) resolves to the *native-tls* backend whenever
//! `default-tls` is enabled and `http3` is not. The Cursor client needs
//! native TLS to get past cursor.com's ClientHello fingerprinting (#1250), so
//! `default-tls` is compiled in on every target except Android — which means
//! an unqualified `reqwest::Client::new()` anywhere in this workspace would
//! silently be a *native-tls* client, not the rustls one its author intended.
//!
//! `clippy.toml` forbids `reqwest::Client::new` / `reqwest::Client::builder`
//! outside this module and `tokscale-cli`'s `cursor.rs` so a new call site
//! cannot re-open that hole by accident.

/// A `reqwest::ClientBuilder` pinned to the rustls backend.
///
/// Behaviourally identical to what an unqualified `reqwest::Client::builder()`
/// produced before native TLS entered the dependency graph: `use_rustls_tls()`
/// selects `TlsBackend::Rustls`, and `tls_built_in_certs_native` defaults to
/// `true`, so roots still come from the OS trust store via the workspace's
/// `rustls-tls-native-roots` feature.
///
/// The workspace also compiles in the Mozilla webpki roots
/// (`rustls-tls-webpki-roots`), and reqwest extends the root store with both
/// sets. This is the #1343 fix: rustls-native-certs honours `SSL_CERT_FILE`
/// as an *exclusive* replacement for the OS store, so a package-manager
/// firewall like `sfw` that points it at a file containing only its own MITM
/// CA used to leave the client unable to validate any host the firewall
/// passes through untouched. With the webpki roots always present the
/// injected CA is additive rather than a replacement.
