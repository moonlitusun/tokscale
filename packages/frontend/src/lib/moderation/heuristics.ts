 *
 *   - Parsers emit it as the model id of a token-bearing message whose model
 *     is missing or blank. `model_id()` in sessions/augment.rs and in
 *     sessions/jcode.rs both return "unknown" for a blank id — augment.rs has
 *     a test asserting exactly that for a message carrying 7 input and 1
 *     output tokens — and sessions/claudecode.rs and sessions/gemini.rs fall
 *     back to the same literal.
 *   - normalizeSubmissionData() in app/api/submit/route.ts rewrites any null,
 *     non-string or whitespace-only `modelId` to the literal "unknown" on
 *     every POST /api/submit, for every client, before validation. The map key
 *     is that value verbatim.
 *   - modelsForHighWater() in lib/db/parserHighWater.ts parks an entry's
 *     unclaimed scalar remainder under `breakdown.modelId || "unknown"`, and
 *     breakdownFromModels() then rewrites the entry's scalar as the sum of
 *     that map. A remainder that used to be visible as `tokens` > Σ`models`
 *     therefore comes back as an explicit cell whose key names nothing, with
 *     the scalar and the nested sum in agreement — so checking only for a
 *     scalar remainder no longer sees it.
 *
 * Treating those tokens as unattributed is correct in every one of the three:
 * a token whose model is the string "unknown" is a token no model claims. But
 * the blast radius is wide and it is not confined to legacy rows — a single
 * such token anywhere in an account's daily rows makes `slopTokens` NULL, so
 * the slopModelName signal keeps its full fixed weight and the #1265 share
 * scaling never applies to that account. That is the fail-closed direction (a
 * share computed from partial attribution can only be too small), and it is
 * chosen deliberately over an upper bound like (slop + unattributed) / total,
 * which puts the fabrication case back on an estimate. Narrowing it needs
 * measured evidence about how `unknown` tokens are distributed across real
 * source_breakdown rows; nobody has run that query, so do not narrow it on the
 * assumption that these cells are rare.
 *
 * Keys holding no alphanumeric character at all are the parser debris
 * documented above (`*`, `{`, `│`), which cannot be a model id either.
 *
 * Bare UUIDs are deliberately NOT matched. They are common debris, but a UUID
 * is also a plausible fine-tune or deployment id, and unlike `unknown` no
 * code path here parks a remainder under one — so treating them as unnamed
 * would pin accounts at full weight on a guess.
