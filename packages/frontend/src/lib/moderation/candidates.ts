    -- own modelId, so this reads it back the same way instead of dropping
    -- it. Without a modelId the remainder belongs to no named model, and it
    -- is deliberately left out of attributed_tokens below.
    --
    -- attributed_nested_tokens is the part of the map that a model actually
    -- claims. It is separate from nested_tokens because the two answer
    -- different questions: the remainder is what the map does not cover
    -- (so it must subtract the WHOLE map, unnamed cells included, or the
    -- same tokens get counted twice), while attribution is what the map
    -- credits to a model (so it must skip the cells that name nothing).
    --
    -- The map is not guaranteed to fit inside the entry's own scalar. When it
    -- does not, the entry contradicts itself: the scalar says N tokens were
    -- submitted and the map claims more than N are accounted for, so nothing
    -- the map holds can be reconciled against the account's total. Such an
    -- entry raises over_nested, and the completeness gate below fails the
    -- whole submission closed on that flag alone.
    --
    -- Such an entry ALSO attributes nothing, but be clear about what that
    -- second guard is worth: it is unobservable. The flag alone already forces
    -- slop_tokens to NULL whatever the attributed sum comes out at, so
    -- removing the zeroing leaves the integration fixture entirely green
    -- (measured: 17/17). It is kept as defence in depth against a future
    -- narrowing of the flag, not because any test can tell it is there — and
    -- for the same reason a clamp put in its place would also look green. The
    -- fixture header records which mutation each persona actually kills.
    --
    -- The flag is load-bearing and the zeroed attribution alone is NOT enough,
    -- because the gate is an inequality over sums and a zero-scalar entry
    -- moves neither side of it. attributed_tokens is compared against
    -- total_tokens, which is SUM(daily.tokens) and in turn SUM(client scalars)
    -- (recalculateDayTotals in lib/db/helpers.ts adds client.tokens || 0).
    -- An entry whose own scalar is 0 or absent therefore adds 0 to the
    -- threshold as well as 0 to the attributed sum, so zeroing it opens no gap
    -- and the gate passes EXACTLY, on the passing side. Measured against
    -- postgres:16 before this flag existed: {claude: scalar 1,200,000 / map
    -- {claude-sonnet-4: 1,200,000}} beside {copilot: scalar 0 / map
    -- {fake-api: 2}} returned slopTokens 2 rather than NULL, weight
    -- 35 * 2/1,200,000, which Math.round drops -- the slopModelName signal
    -- vanished and rankCandidates() dropped the account. Deleting the tokens
    -- key outright behaved identically. This is the same failure the clamp
    -- note below describes, one construction over: there the ceiling equals
    -- the scalar, here the ceiling IS zero and so is the scalar.
    --
    -- nested_slop_tokens is deliberately NOT zeroed alongside the attribution.
    -- It is the numerator, and zeroing it would round the weight to 0 on its
    -- own -- fail-open by a second route -- if this gate were ever loosened.
    -- The over-nested entry's slop tokens are only ever read when the whole
    -- submission is already NULL, so the pass-through is inert by design.
    --
    -- applyCostCompleteness() in lib/db/helpers.ts unions the stored and
    -- incoming model maps while taking the scalar from the incoming entry, so
    -- a same-device resubmit declaring costIsComplete:false (#1044) that drops
    -- a previously-seen model stores exactly that divergence.
    --
    -- CLAMPING the named sum instead is what let this fail open before the
    -- flag existed. Reading that history as current behaviour would be wrong:
    -- with over_nested standing, the clamp below decides nothing either way.
    -- It is recorded because it explains why the guard has to sit OUTSIDE the
    -- attributed sum. Every clamp of the named cells has a
    -- ceiling of the entry's OWN scalar, while the gate's threshold is
    -- total_tokens -- the sum of those same scalars. So a clamped over-nested
    -- entry does not land below the gate, it lands exactly ON it, which is the
    -- passing side. GREATEST(LEAST(named, scalar - unnamed), 0) only bit when
    -- an unnamed cell happened to subtract from that ceiling; with the excess
    -- under a real model name, or in a map holding no unnamed cell at all
    -- (stored {claude-sonnet-4: N} merged with an incoming legacy-partial
    -- {fake-api: 2}), attribution came back equal to the total while only 2
    -- tokens were backed by the submission that set the scalar.
    --
    -- On a well-formed entry, whose map fits inside its scalar, this is inert:
    -- named <= nested <= scalar, so no clamp was ever doing work there.
