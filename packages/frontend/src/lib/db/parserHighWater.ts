/**
 * Clients whose submissions are bounded by a device/client lifetime
 * high-water instead of being merged day by day, mapped to the parser
 * generation the server accepts.
 *
 * A client belongs here when its parser can re-attribute usage it has already
 * submitted. The per-day merge guard refuses a decrease per (day, client), so
 * a re-attribution that moves tokens between days pins the days that fall and
 * writes the days that rise, inflating the stored total by exactly what moved.
 *
 * Copilot is pinned at generation 2 because generation 1 counted differently
 * and must not advance the high-water. Droid is registered at generation 1,
 * the generation every CLI already declares: its shapes differ in *where*
 * tokens land, never in the lifetime total. A full snapshot that still
 * covers the credited lifetime therefore replaces stored days so the web
 * graph matches the TUI, without the per-day merge guard inflating totals.
 *
 * Both Antigravity clients are registered at generation 1, the generation every
 * CLI already declares. Their parsers stopped dating usage at the session's
 * start: `antigravity-cli` reads a per-generation stamp out of `gen_metadata`,
 * and `antigravity` correlates standalone rows to trajectory steps. A rescan
 * therefore moves unchanged usage off the session-start day and onto the days
 * the work actually happened, which is precisely the shape the per-day guard
 * turns into permanent inflation. Antigravity CLI is registered at
 * generation 1 for the same reason: its turns used to be dated at the session
 * start and are now dated by the timestamp of the generation that produced
 * them, so a rescan spreads an unchanged session across the days it actually
 * ran without changing what it spent.
